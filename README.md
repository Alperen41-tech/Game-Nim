#Game Nim
Nim is a mathematical strategy game for two players. The game begins with several piles of objects, and players take turns removing any number of objects from a single pile. The player who removes the last object loses the game.
The AI starts with no prior knowledge of the game.
  - It learns optimal moves through exploration (trying random moves) and exploitation (choosing the best-known moves).
  - The AI improves by playing thousands of simulated games against itself.
  - Winning and losing outcomes reinforce the effectiveness of specific moves in given states.
